        At YSKAIPE, we are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your rights regarding your data. It applies to our website (yskaipe.com), waitlist sign-ups, platform previews, and any related services (collectively, the “Services”).
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-12">

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information from third parties</strong><br>
          If you connect via third-party services (e.g., Google, GitHub, Slack in the future), we may receive limited profile data with your permission.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share it only in these limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>With service providers</strong>: Vendors who help us operate the Services (hosting, analytics, email delivery, etc.), bound by strict confidentiality</li>
        <li><strong>For legal reasons</strong>: To comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights/safety, or enforce our terms</li>
        <li><strong>In connection with a business transfer</strong>: If we are acquired or merge, your information may transfer (with notice where required)</li>
        <li><strong>With your consent</strong>: When you explicitly agree (e.g., sharing project details within a matched pod)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We keep your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the Services, fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, or meet legal obligations. Waitlist data may be retained until you unsubscribe or we determine it is no longer needed. You can request deletion at any time (see Your Rights below).</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights including:</p>

        <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal information</li>
        <li>Opt out of marketing communications</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing</li>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">6. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>YSKAIPE is based in the United States. If you are located outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. or other countries. We take appropriate safeguards to protect your data in accordance with this policy and applicable law.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">7. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for essential functionality, analytics (e.g., Google Analytics), and performance. You can manage preferences via your browser settings. For more details, see our Cookie Policy [link to future cookie page if created].</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn we have collected such data, we will delete it promptly.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the revised version here and update the “Last updated” date. For material changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g., email or site banner). Continued use of the Services after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
