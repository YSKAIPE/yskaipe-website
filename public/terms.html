By submitting content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, display, and perform that content solely to provide, maintain, improve, and promote the Services.</p>
      <p>You are solely responsible for your content and represent that it does not infringe any third-party rights.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The Services, including all text, graphics, logos, software, AI models, designs, and features, are owned by YSKAIPE or our licensors and protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">6. Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
      <p>The Services may include links to or integrations with third-party services (e.g., OpenAI, Slack, GitHub in the future). We are not responsible for those services or their privacy practices. Your use of third-party services is governed by their own terms.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without cause or notice, including for violation of these Terms.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">10. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the revised version here and update the “Last updated” date. For material changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g., email or site banner). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
